# Description

A blog post application created by 00009553 student at wiut. You can post your plogs there. Any blog can be written. To do that, you should first add a title and then write the content of your blog. You can creare, delete, and archieve your blog there. It is pretty easy and fun! The creating of the app was very enjoyable and hard at the same time. I hope you will like it.
